# Ecommerce-front-end-design

This project is my first internship project, where I developed a responsive and dynamic front-end for an eCommerce website. 

## Features
- 🛒 **Product Listings**: Displays a range of products with details like name, price, and images.
- 🔍 **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for products by keyword.
- 🗂️ **Categories & Filters**: Enables filtering products by category and price range.
- 🌐 **Interactive UI**: Implemented features such as hover effects, clickable cards, and more.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Markup structure of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling for layout and design.


## Future Improvements
- Plans to add features like user authentication, a shopping cart, or integrating a back-end.
